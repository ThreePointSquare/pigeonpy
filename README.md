# PigeonPy 

I started this in mid 2017 as a way to learn how the Forge API worked, and also to try to learn Angular.

It uses Flask as a backend to handle authentication and routing to interact with Autodesk's Forge API, and small Angular client application.

I have since abondoned this project but wanted to share it here as some of it could be useful to anyone trying to use Forge. 

While the front end stuff is unfinished and brittle, I think there are some good Flask patterns 
to handle (Forge) Oauth for both Applicationa and USer.

The Demo is still alive on [www.pigeonpy.com](http://www.pigeonpy.com)
